# Password-Generator


This project is a Java Console Application to generate random passwords and perform password strength checks.

# Introduction


I decided to build this project during the Winter Break of my second year after taking the Object-Oriented 
Effective Java Programming course. I wanted to build something interesting with Java to practice and see what 
I could do on my own. However, I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Then one night, while explaining to my 
father the importance of having a strong password for his social media accounts, I got the idea of creating a random password generator. A week later, it was done.

While working on it, I decided to include a password strength checker feature that checks the overall strength 
of the entered password. I was pretty happy with how it turned out, but I realized that it was not very 
straightforward to use for someone who does not know how it is supposed to work. So, I decided to create a GUI 
for the application for the next step, which is available in the Password-Services repository.
